A application simulating an e-commerce focused on selling video-game consoles and accessories.
You can search for the products, see prodcuts pages for more in depth descriptions, add and remove products from the cart (that persists your products in local storage) and "finish your order", simulating a purchase.

The Application is connected with a MongoDB database where it fetch data for the products and simulate purchases, adding orders details to the database.

The application was built with Next.js (using pages router), axios for data fetch and make orders, mongoose to connect with MongoDB and SASS for 
stylization.
